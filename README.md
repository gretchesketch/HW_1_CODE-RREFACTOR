Homework week 1: Code Refactor
Gretchen Jensen

HTML:
Replaced all div elements with appropriate element sections. Removed class attributes that were no longer useful. Added comments to describe the different sections. Added alt tags to the images for screen readers.

CSS:
Combined repeated css properties. Used comments to describe the slecters and properties present. Updated useless classes to element selectors.
